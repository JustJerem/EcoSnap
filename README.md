# EcoSnap

A **community-driven** application designed to identify, report, and clean up polluted or
disaster-affected areas. **EcoSnap** empowers individuals worldwide to actively participate in
environmental protection by reporting polluted locations and earning rewards for their
contributions.

The app fosters a **collaborative approach**, turning every user into a changemaker. By enabling
citizens, NGOs, and local authorities to coordinate effectively, **EcoSnap** transforms waste
reporting into a community-driven initiative for a cleaner planet.

This app is particularly valuable in regions facing severe urban pollution issues, where waste
management is often inadequate.  
Countries such as **India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt**, and other **Southeast Asian nations**
suffer from overflowing streets and inefficient waste collection. **EcoSnap** provides local
populations with a tool to self-organize, collaborate with authorities and NGOs, and improve their
living environment.

By promoting **citizen engagement and collective responsibility**, **EcoSnap** transforms
environmental cleanup efforts into a positive, rewarding, and community-driven movement. üåç‚ôªÔ∏è

## Features

- **Report Polluted Areas**  
  Users can capture one or more photos of polluted locations and submit a report directly through
  the app.

- **Community Participation**  
  Users can add additional photos and tag other participants, earning more points and increasing
  their impact within the community.

- **Interactive Map - Next Update**  
  Access a real-time map showcasing all reported polluted areas. A future update will allow users to
  see their friends‚Äô contributions as well.

- **Cleanup Validation**  
  Upon selecting a reported location, users are prompted to upload an ‚Äúafter‚Äù photo of the cleaned
  site and tag participants who contributed.

- **Points and Rewards System**  
  Each action earns users points, which are credited to their profile once validated by the
  appropriate authorities.

- **Collaboration with NGOs and Local Authorities**  
  EcoSnap helps citizens connect with NGOs and government agencies to organize cleanups and improve
  waste management efficiency.

### Additional Highlights

- **Dark & Light Mode**  
  Supports both dark and light themes for an optimal user experience across various lighting
  conditions.

## Technical Highlights

- Written entirely in **Kotlin**.
- Built with **Jetpack Compose** for a declarative and modern UI.
- Integrates **Koin** for dependency injection, ensuring modularity and easy testability.
- Utilizes **Android Jetpack** components, including:
  - **ViewModel** for state management.
  - **StateFlow** for reactive data handling.
  - **Navigation Component** for seamless navigation between screens.
- Implements **Clean Architecture** and the **MVI pattern** for a clear separation of concerns and
  maintainability.
- Designed as a **multi-module** application, allowing individual modules‚Äîparticularly the camera
  module‚Äîto be reused in other applications.
- Uses a **build logic** approach, centralizing all Gradle configurations in a single place, making
  the project easier to maintain and scale.
- Follows an **offline-first** approach with **Room Database** and **DataStore**, allowing smooth
  operation even without an Internet connection.
